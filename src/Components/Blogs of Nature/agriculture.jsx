            <p>Agroforestry is a method of using trees and shrubs into agricultural systems to increase productivity and sustain the environment. It maximises land use, preserves soil, and enhances biodiversity by fusing trees with agricultural crops.</p>
            <p>Crops and livestock benefit from trees' shade, windbreaks, and nutrient cycling. There exist several types of agroforestry systems: silvopasture, which involves planting trees alongside crops; alley cropping, which involves growing non-timber trees under tree Shades; and forest farming.</p>
            <p>This method promotes resilient and sustainable agricultural landscapes by increasing farmers' revenue streams, improving water quality, sequestering carbon, and boosting their resistance to climate change.</p>
